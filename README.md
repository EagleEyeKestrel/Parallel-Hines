Parallel version of hines algorithm.

To compile the source cpp, move to the Project directory and run the command: `sh script/compile.sh`, then we can move to src and do `./serial ../data/caseX.txt ../sresult/resX.txt` or `./parallel ../data/caseX.txt ../presult/resX.txt` to run the executable file.(the sresult and presult files are removed according to requirements)
